# Hangman Game

This project is a remake of the familiar game ***Hangman***, using react. 

# Game explaination

If you are not familiar with the game, you simply guess the correct word letter-by-letter with a limited ammount of chances to guess correctly. If you guess every letter correctly, the correct word is spelt to you and you win the game. However, if you guess incorrectly (say, 10 out of 10 guesses were wrong), you lose the game depicted by a hanged man.

# Installation

After downloading the files into your device, go to the file directory and run:
```cmd
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary *node_modules*

# Usage

For whichever code editor you choose, open the terminal in your editor and make sure the file path is directed to the file where you have installed the source code and run:
```cmd
npm start
```
This should startup the browser and redirect you to `localhost:3000`
